# Data Analysis for Healthcare Performance Evaluation

## Executive Summary
This project utilizes SAS to analyze healthcare performance data, focusing on patient metrics and target values across multiple time periods. The dataset, imported from a CSV file, is structured to evaluate trends in patient volumes (patients1 to patients7) and their corresponding target values. The objective is to identify performance gaps, optimize resource allocation, and enhance healthcare service delivery.

## Business Problem
Healthcare institutions need robust data-driven insights to monitor patient inflows and benchmark against set targets. Without effective analysis, there is a risk of resource misallocation, inefficiencies in patient care, and difficulty in achieving performance goals. This project aims to bridge that gap by leveraging SAS-based data mining techniques.

## Methodology
- **Data Importation & Processing**: Imported CSV data into SAS using PROC IMPORT and structured it into a SAS dataset.
- **Data Cleaning & Formatting**: Defined data types, applied formatting, and structured variables for analysis.
- **Trend Analysis**: Compared patient volumes against target values across different time periods.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assessed deviations between actual patient numbers and targets to highlight areas of improvement.

## Technologies & Tools Used
- **SAS**: Used for data processing, statistical analysis, and visualization.
- **CSV**: Data source format used for importing patient data.
- **Microsoft Excel**: For preliminary data review and validation.
- **Data Mining Techniques**: Applied in SAS for trend identification and performance evaluation.

## Key Findings
- There are fluctuations in patient volumes over time, with some periods showing a significant gap between actual and target values.
- Certain regions or units may be consistently underperforming, indicating inefficiencies in healthcare service delivery.
- The data structure allows for deeper insights into how resource allocation impacts performance.

## Business Recommendations
- **Optimize Resource Allocation**: Based on patient trends, adjust staffing, medical supplies, and operational resources to align with demand.
- **Targeted Interventions**: Identify underperforming units/regions and implement strategic improvements.
- **Predictive Analysis for Proactive Planning**: Use historical patient data to forecast future demand and prepare accordingly.
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Set realistic, data-driven targets to enhance operational efficiency.
- **Automated Data Pipelines**: Implement continuous data updates to ensure real-time monitoring and faster decision-making.

## Next Steps
- **Advanced Statistical Analysis**: Apply predictive modeling techniques to anticipate patient trends.
- **Visualization & Reporting**: Develop dashboards to track healthcare performance in real-time.
- **Integration with Healthcare Systems**: Connect SAS models with hospital management systems for seamless data flow.
- **A/B Testing**: Experiment with resource allocation strategies to measure effectiveness.

By leveraging SAS for data-driven decision-making, healthcare organizations can improve efficiency, enhance patient care, and achieve operational excellence.
